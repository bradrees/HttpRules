<!-- The third rule here rewrites profile picture URLs to follow a
     pattern that Twitter currently uses itself, but inconsistently. 
     Using this pattern now makes most user pages load successfully
     in HTTPS instead of giving a mixed content warning. -->

<!-- There are still some hosts that things get loaded from that can't
     be safely rewritten without triggering a certificate error.
     E.g. platform.twitter.com has some scripts, but the https version
     won't validate. -->
